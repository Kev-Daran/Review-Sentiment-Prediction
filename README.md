# Sentiment Analysis on Large-Scale Text Datasets using Traditional and Transformer-Based Models

This project explores the performance of both traditional NLP methods (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression) and modern transformer-based embeddings (DistilBERT) for sentiment classification on large-scale datasets. It emphasizes the challenges and design trade-offs of handling large data using distributed systems like PySpark and embedding-heavy models in memory-constrained environments.
